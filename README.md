# School study system

NB! Original repo was made in school's private repo gitlab.cs.ttu and it is not possible to make it public there.

### Description
We were given fun task - create MVP for school study system that would include semesters with subjects in them, teachers, students, grading system, some statistics etc. This is had to be made in limited time range (~10 hours). \
Focus was more on the back-end side - designing relational database and making web application to select, insert, update and delete data. On front-end side - at first pages were scaffolded to validate CRUD operations. Additional pages were made with .NET Razor and some Bootstrap.
